# bouncy-ball
Given user input for:
- Chosen Celestial body
- Initial height
- Minimum height
- 'Bounce efficiency'
  - value between 0 (no bounces) and 1 (infinite bounces)

  
This program returns the number of bounces over the minimum height and how many seconds it takes to complete the bounces. The program also validates user inputs to ensure they work in the code. An additional validation of the inital height being in line with the mgh approximation is also included
